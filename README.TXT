PROJECT TITLE: ExplosiveEvasion

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: 

Challenge players to navigate a rocket through space while avoiding bombs. The goal is to test quick reflexes and decision-making skills in a fun and fast-paced environment. This game offers replayability and increasing difficulty, pushing players to beat their own high scores.

VERSION or DATE: December 2023

AUTHORS: Amreen Kaur and Michelle Lee

USER INSTRUCTIONS: 

Use the 'Up', 'Down', 'Left' and 'Right' arrow keys to navigate your rocket towards the yellow points, while avoiding the bombs. Making contact with the bombs docks a point, while a yellow point gains you one. The goal is to stay in the game long as possible! You may reset the game to create a new one, but the high score remains, so you can constantly try and beat it!
